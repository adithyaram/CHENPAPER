abstract  ="Micro and nanoparticle adsorption to and assembly by capillarity at fluid-fluid interfaces are intriguing aspects of soft matter science with broad potential in the directed assembly of anisotropic media. The importance of the field stems from the ubiquitous presence of multiphase systems{,} the malleability of fluid interfaces{,} and the ability to tune the interactions of the particles adsorbed on them. While homogeneous spherical particles at interfaces have been well studied{,} the behavior of anisotropic particles - whether the anisotropy originates from shape or chemical heterogeneity - has been considered only very recently. We review recent advances in the field of anisotropic particles at fluid interfaces{,} by focusing on particles in the micron and submicron range. We discuss capillary adsorption{,} orientation{,} migration{,} and self-assembly{,} on planar and curved interfaces{,} and the rheology of particle-laden interfaces. Prospects for future work and outstanding challenges are also discussed."},

abstract  ="We report on the formation of organized assemblies of 1 [small mu ]m-in-diameter colloids (polystyrene (PS)) at the poles of water-dispersed droplets (diameters 7-20 [small mu ]m) of nematic liquid crystal (LC). For 4-cyano-4[prime or minute]-pentylbiphenyl droplets decorated with two to five PS colloids{,} we found 32 distinct arrangements of the colloids to form at the boojums of bipolar droplet configurations. Significantly{,} all but one of these configurations (a ring comprised of five PS colloids) could be mapped onto a local (non-close packed) hexagonal lattice. To provide insight into the origin of the hexagonal lattice{,} we investigated planar aqueous-LC interfaces{,} and found that organized assemblies of PS colloids did not form at these interfaces. Experiments involving the addition of salts revealed that a repulsive interaction of electrostatic origin prevented formation of assemblies at planar interfaces{,} and that regions of high splay near the poles of the LC droplets generated cohesive interactions between colloids that could overcome the repulsion. Support for this interpretation was obtained from a model that included (i) a long-range attraction between adsorbed colloids and the boojum due to the increasing rate of strain (splay) of LC near the boojum (splay attraction){,} (ii) an attractive inter-colloid interaction that reflects the quadrupolar symmetry of the strain in the LC around the colloids{,} and (iii) electrostatic repulsion between colloids. The model predicts that electrostatic repulsion between colloids can lead to a [similar]1000kBT energy barrier at planar interfaces of LC films{,} and that the repulsive interaction can be overcome by splay attraction of the colloids to the boojums of the LC droplets. Overall{,} the results reported in this paper advance our understanding of the directed assembly of colloids at interfaces of LC droplets."}

Electrowetting is found to suppress coffee stains of both colloidal particles of various sizes and DNA solutions at alternating (AC) frequencies ranging from a few Hertz to a few tens of kHz. Two main effects are shown to contribute to the suppression: (i) the time-dependent electrostatic force prevents pinning of the three phase contact line and (ii) internal flow fields generated by AC electrowetting counteract the evaporation driven flux and thereby prevent the accumulation of solutes along the contact line."}

abstract  ="The contact line dynamics during the evaporation of nano-droplets sessile on textured solid substrates is investigated using molecular dynamics method. Our simulations reproduce the nanoscale physical phenomena such as the constant contact angle (CCA) and constant contact radius (CCR) evaporation modes which have been reported in recent experiments. The results also show that the localized liquid-solid interaction in the vicinity of the contact line dominates the wetting behavior on the textured surfaces{,} which also indicates a molecular origin of the pinning force. Increase of the characteristic width of the inhomogeneity enlarges the energy barrier to jumping out a hydrophilic textured element{,} which further results in a larger pinning force. For the evaporation of a nano-droplet on the surface with large pinning force{,} the anchoring of the contact line and the CCR mode are observed at the first onset. While on the textured surfaces with smaller characteristic width of the inhomogeneity{,} only the CCA and mixed modes can be found during the evaporation. This work provides a foundation on which the sessile nano-droplet evaporation can be understood from atomistic scale."}

Transmission and scanning electron micrographs revealed that the growth of the disks is mediated by oriented attachment{,} which happened continuously throughout the hydrothermal treatment between various sized disks. Ostwald ripening is effective in improving the regularity of the shape of the disks{,} especially under prolonged hydrothermal treatment. Preferred attachment among the flat surfaces of the disks leads to the diverse developments of their size and thickness polydispersities."}

abstract ={Capillarity can be used to direct anisotropic colloidal particles to precise locations and to orient them by using interface curvature as an applied field. We show this in experiments in which the shape of the interface is molded by pinning to vertical pillars of different cross-sections. These interfaces present well-defined curvature fields that orient and steer particles along complex trajectories. Trajectories and orientations are predicted by a theoretical model in which capillary forces and torques are related to Gaussian curvature gradients and angular deviations from principal directions of curvature. Interface curvature diverges near sharp boundaries, similar to an electric field near a pointed conductor. We exploit this feature to induce migration and assembly at preferred locations, and to create complex structures. We also report a repulsive interaction, in which microparticles move away from planar bounding walls along curvature gradient contours. These phenomena should be widely useful in the directed assembly of micro- and nanoparticles with potential application in the fabrication of materials with tunable mechanical or electronic properties, in emulsion production, and in encapsulation.},

abstract ={Objects floating at a liquid interface, such as breakfast cereals floating in a bowl of milk or bubbles at the surface of a soft drink, clump together as a result of capillary attraction. This attraction arises from deformation of the liquid interface due to gravitational forces; these deformations cause excess surface area that can be reduced if the particles move closer together. For micrometer-sized colloids, however, the gravitational force is too small to produce significant interfacial deformations, so capillary forces between spherical colloids at a flat interface are negligible. Here, we show that this is different when the confining liquid interface has a finite curvature that is also anisotropic. In that case, the condition of constant contact angle along the three-phase contact line can only be satisfied when the interface is deformed. We present experiments and numerical calculations that demonstrate how this leads to quadrupolar capillary interactions between the particles, giving rise to organization into regular square lattices. We demonstrate that the strength of the governing anisotropic interactions can be rescaled with the deviatoric curvature alone, irrespective of the exact shape of the liquid interface. Our results suggest that anisotropic interactions can easily be induced between isotropic colloids through tailoring of the interfacial curvature.},

In the well-dispersed suspension, the three-phase boundary was pinned and radial flow created a peripheral wall. The platelet structure involved local flat packing but was replete with scrolls that result from the recirculation flows in the droplets as they dry. In contrast, the flocculating suspension produced flatter droplet relics and the microstructure consisted of ordered domains which were disoriented with respect to each other.

During the spontaneous evaporation of a droplet in air under atmospheric conditions, the solvent evaporates and nano-particles are deposited onto the substrate. Depending on the concentration, two different patterns are observed: an o-ring pattern and a continuous nano-particle flower pattern. We observe a critical concentration that corresponds to the transition between the two patterns. Humidity is controlled and modified to investigate its effect on the evaporation dynamics and on pattern formation. Surprisingly, the leading pattern is identical regardless of the evaporation time, and the evaporative mass fluxes measured are slightly higher than the expected flux, following a classical purely diffusive model for pure fluids. Two explanations are proposed: the first is that the diffusion coefficient of the nanofluid in humid air is different from that of pure water in dry air. The second is based on the experimental observation of an increase in the spreading of the nanofluid, leading to an increase in the drop perimeter, a decrease in the contact angle and thus an improvement in the evaporation rate.

The optical properties of the obtained opaline structures have been investigated. The deposition process of colloidial silica spheres and the fine structure of opal films have been examined by SEM. It was shown that the surface charge of particles, modified or screened by pH and counterions, has a crucial role in the formation of homogeneous and well ordered opal films. The present work supplied an essential comprehension of the self-assembly of SiO2 spheres towards a better control of vertical deposition method leading to high quality opal-based photonic crystals.

We show that the detailed nanostructure and micromorphology in the residual thin film depend intricately on the ambient moisture{,} nanofluid solvent composition and substrate surface chemistry. Upon thermal annealing{,} these Zn(OH)2 fibres readily undergo further chemical and morphological transformation{,} forming nanoporous fibres with the pore size tuneable by temperature. Our results point to a simple route for generating a self-assembled 3D structure with ultralong and nanoporous ZnO/Zn(OH)2 fibres/belts{,} and may also be of interest to the fields of evaporation controlled dynamic self-assembly{,} non-equilibrium crystallisation{,} and flow and fingering instabilities in nanofluids."}

abstract  ="A {"}particle-on-film{"} template is developed to fabricate self-organized surface patterns through solvent evaporation on initially featureless{,} sub-micron PMMA films. The small particle placed on the pre-cast PMMA film is able to confine a toluene droplet and influence the evaporative process. Well-ordered gradient concentric rings are formed around the particle due to the unconventional {"}advancing-receding{"} motion of the contact line in the {"}stick{"} state on the surface of the PMMA films. Both the center-to-center distance between adjacent rings (wavelength) and the height of the rings (amplitude) are strongly dependent on the particle size and the film thickness{,} and decrease with the decrease of the distance to the center of the particle. A linear dependence of the amplitude of the rings on the wavelength is observed under experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that the {"}particle-on-film{"} template has the potential to fabricate highly-ordered surface patterns economically and efficiently."}

abstract  ="Deposition morphologies of inkjet-printed colloidal drops are examined under various drying conditions{,} particle volume fractions{,} and particle sizes. Concentric multi-rings{,} radial spokes{,} spider web{,} foam{,} and island-like depositions are observed as a result of the competition between the receding contact line and particle deposition during drop drying. Experimentally measured multi-ring spacing{,} [small delta]R{,} shows good agreement with the model predicted linear correlation with the local ring radius R. The results also show that the instability near the contact line leads to the radial spoke and saw-toothed structures. The resulting wavelength of the radial structures{,} [small lambda]{,} satisfies and {,} where RH is the relative humidity. A dimensionless parameter [small xi]{,} defined as the radial deposition growth rate to contact line velocity ratio{,} has been identified to determine the conditions under which the entire contact line can be pinned to leave a continuous ring deposit. Increasing the particle size while keeping the volume fraction the same is found to suppress the formation of the multi-ring deposition{,} due to a smaller number of particles available to pin the receding contact line."}
